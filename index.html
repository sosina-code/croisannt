   <h1>🥐 croissant</h1> 
   <p>
    It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl,
     but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.
     Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. 
     The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession,
      then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. 
     The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry
